    <p1>It would mean the whole wide world to me <br>
        If I could only hear you sing<br>A secret for us to keep<br>As we drift off to sleep<br>
        It would mean the whole wide world to me<br>If I could only watch you sleep<br>
        And count your breaths<br>And feel your chest<br>As your heart beats and beats<br><br>
        At 5:55<br>You'll be on my mind<br>Just like every other second anyway<br>At 5:55<br>
        I'll be glad to be alive<br>So I can tell you that I love you everyday<br><br>
        It would mean the whole wide world to me<br>If I could be there for everything<br>
        To love your best and love your worst<br>And everything that's inbetween<br><br>
        At 5:55<br>You'll be on my mind<br>Just like every other second anyway<br>At 5:55<br>
        I'll be glad to be alive<br>So I can tell you that I love you everyday<br><br>
        At 5:55<br>You'll be on my mind<br>Just like every other minute of the day<br>At 5:55<br>
        I'll be glad to be alive<br>So I can tell you that I love you Courtney Rae<br><br>
